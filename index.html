            <h4>FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>I specialize in applications written in both React and Angular. Recently I became also a huge fan of one-way data flow and Redux-like architecture and also typed languages, e.g. TypeScript.</p>
            <h5>My current experience and skills in front-end includes:</h5>
            <ul>
